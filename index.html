          We often blame problems on "the system." But what exactly
          <em>is</em> the system? And which part of the system is causing the
          problem?
        </p>
        <p>
          That's the key characteristic of systemic problems: often, none of the
          individual parts are broken. The issue lies in how these parts
          interact, the overall outcomes the system produces, and the lack of
          considerations or forsight when the system was designed.

        <h4>What is a System?</h4>
        <p>
          A system is a collection of interconnected parts working together
          towards a common purpose. Think of a car: the engine, transmission,
          wheels, and steering all function independently, but they must
          interact seamlessly for the car to drive. Systems exist everywhere,
          from natural ecosystems to social structures.
        </p>
        <h4>What is a Problem?</h4>
        <p>
          A problem is a situation, condition, or issue that is unsatisfactory,
          undesirable, or harmful. It represents a deviation from a desired
          state or outcome and typically requires action or intervention to
          resolve or solution.
        </p>
        <h4>What is a Systemic Problem?</h4>
        <p>
          A systemic problem is an issue that's baked into the structure of a
          system, leading to recurring negative outcomes. Imagine a factory
          where workers are constantly getting injured. A systemic problem might
          be a lack of safety training or poorly maintained equipment - issues
          that affect the whole system and lead to repeated accidents, rather
          than a single incident caused by one worker's mistake.

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>The Gender Pay Gap:</h3>
            <p><strong>Disenfranchised Group:</strong> Women</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem*:</strong> Overall, women are paid less than men.
              On average, women working full-time, year-round are paid 84% of
              what men are paid. In other words, the typical woman working
              full-time would need to work from January 1, 2023, until March 12,
              2024, to make what the typical man working full-time made in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Common Misconception:</strong> It's often assumed that the
              gender pay gap is simply a matter of women being paid less for the
              same work, but it's more nuanced than that. Factors like
              occupational segregation (where women are concentrated in
              lower-paying fields) and the undervaluing of female-dominated
              professions contribute significantly. Additionally, implicit
              biases in hiring and promotion processes can subtly disadvantage
              women even when there's no overt intention to discriminate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Roadblocks to Progress:</strong> Closing the gap requires
              addressing deeply ingrained societal biases, changing corporate
              cultures, and potentially legislative action regarding pay
              transparency and equal pay for equal work. These changes are
              complex, encounter resistance, and take time to implement
              effectively.

            <h3>Climate Change:</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Disenfranchised Group:</strong> Marginalized communities
              and future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem*:</strong> The Earth's climate is changing at an
              alarming rate, leading to rising sea levels, extreme weather
              events, and disruptions to ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Common Misconception:</strong> While individual actions
              are important, the problem is primarily systemic, driven by a
              reliance on fossil fuels, unsustainable industrial practices, and
              a lack of global cooperation. Many people acknowledge climate
              change but feel that actions they themselves can take are too
              small to make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Roadblocks to Progress:</strong> Requires global
              cooperation to transition away from fossil fuels, adopt
              sustainable practices, and invest in climate mitigation and
              adaptation. This involves overcoming political hurdles, economic
              interests, and differing priorities among nations, making a rapid
              and unified solution difficult. Individually it can seem helpless
              to some, as they don't witness the impact their individual
              contributions might make.

            <h3>Healthcare Inequality:</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Disenfranchised Group:</strong> Low-income individuals,
              racial and ethnic minorities, and those living in underserved
              areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem*:</strong> Access to quality, affordable
              healthcare varies significantly, resulting in disparities in
              health outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Common Misconception:</strong> It's easy to assume that
              people without health insurance simply choose not to have it, but
              this ignores the complex systemic barriers that prevent many from
              accessing affordable care. These barriers include poverty, lack of
              access to transportation, discriminatory practices, and the
              geographic maldistribution of healthcare resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Roadblocks to Progress:</strong> Addressing healthcare
              inequality often involves systemic reforms such as expanding
              insurance coverage, increasing funding for community health
              centers, and addressing discriminatory practices. These changes
              can be politically charged, face resistance from vested interests,
              and require substantial financial investment.

        <h2>The Problem with Systemic Problems</h2>
        <p>
          Systemic problems are complex because they're rarely caused by a
          single faulty component. Instead, the problem lies in the
          relationships and interactions between the parts. This makes solutions
          more challenging, requiring a deeper understanding of the whole system
          rather than just fixing individual elements.
